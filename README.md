## Post Credits

A post is credited to an author and/or an illustrator.

This is displayed on a single post page, prepended with credit text. This text is configurable as a theme option under:

Appearance > Customize > Theme Options > Post Options

Here, by changing the *Author Credit* and *Illustrator Credit* fields, a post can be changed from displaying the default:
*Written by __author_name__*

*Image by __illustrator_name__*
